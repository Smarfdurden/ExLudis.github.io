        <h2>Marvel Rivals: Sharks with Freakin' Laser Beams</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="excerpt"> I’ll be honest, I’ve never been much of a Marvel fan. The main culprit is the art; I’ve just never really enjoyed looking at it very much. I’ve only watched a handful of the movies, and I thought they were okay, but I felt they were never worth my time or effort to watch them. I did enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, and Dr. Strange so it’s not like I’m incapable of enjoying Marvel properties. It's just never really clicked with me.</p>

        <h2>Disappointees 2024</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="excerpt">This is a new series that I'm going to do at the end of each year along with my Game of the Year list. There's always games that I felt could have been good, but just left me feeling disappointed. If I can think of any good ideas, I may even include a trophy to hand out to all of them. I was thinking something along the lines of a "Gold trophy filled to the brim with boiling sewage", but I'll workshop it.</p>

        <h2>My Top 5 Games of 2024</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="excerpt"> This was a strange year for me when it comes to gaming. I was interested in very few of the new games coming out and didn’t necessarily want to spend money on them. The games that I did play, I managed to play because I rented them with Gamefly, but shipping speed put a damper on how quickly I could play them.</p>

        <h2>Astrobot - Gnome Sized, but not a Gnome</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="excerpt"> Astrobot is one of the best-feeling games on PlayStation and one of the only 3D platformers on the system. Like the demo before it, Astrobot makes great use of dual sense features, which was a highlight for me. I loved feeling all the different materials astro would walk on, and I spent much time seeing what I could interact with to give me that next hit of dual sense crack.</p>

        <h2>Dragon Age: Veilguard – The Dreadwolfening</h2>
		<p class="excerpt"> Dragon Age is a series that over the past two decades has transformed itself with every entry, and Dragon Age: Veilguard is no exception. The combat is a lot more action-oriented, continuing to stray even farther from the turn-based mechanics and deep storyline from the original Dragon Age: Origins. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was a disappointment to fans that longed for the return of the mechanics of the old Dragon Age games.</p>
