    <p class="excerpt"> Dragon Age is a series that over the past two decades has transformed itself with every entry, and Dragon Age: Veilguard is no exception. The combat is a lot more action-oriented, continuing to stray even farther from the turn-based mechanics and deep storyline from the original Dragon Age: Origins. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was a disappointment to fans that longed for the return of the mechanics of the old Dragon Age games.</p>
