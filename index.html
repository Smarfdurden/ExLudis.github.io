        <h2>Everything you need to know about Assassin's Creed Shadows </h2>
		
		<p class="excerpt"> Ubisoft has once again shown off more Assassins Creed: Shadows gameplay - this time focusing on exploration. Ubisoft has previously shown off gameplay for stealth, combat, parkour and now exploration - which will presumably be the last blog before the game releases on March 20. </p>

        <h2>Marvel Rivals: Sharks with Freakin' Laser Beams</h2>
		
		<p class="excerpt"> I’ll be honest, I’ve never been much of a Marvel fan. The main culprit is the art; I’ve just never really enjoyed looking at it very much. I’ve only watched a handful of the movies, and I thought they were okay, but I felt they were never worth my time or effort to watch them.</p>

        <h2 class="centered-headline">Dragon Age: Veilguard – The Dreadwolfening</h2>
		
		<p class="excerpt"> Dragon Age is a series that over the past two decades has transformed itself with every entry, and Dragon Age: Veilguard is no exception. The combat is a lot more action-oriented, continuing to stray even farther from the turn-based mechanics and deep storyline from the original Dragon Age: Origins. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was a disappointment to fans that longed for the return of the mechanics of the old Dragon Age games.</p>

		<p class="excerpt"> Astrobot is one of the best-feeling games on PlayStation and one of the only 3D platformers on the system. Like the demo before it, Astrobot makes great use of dual sense features, which was a highlight for me. I loved feeling all the different materials astro would walk on, and I spent much time seeing what I could interact with to give me that next hit of dual sense crack.</p>

        <h2>Smarf's Top 5 Games of 2024</h2>
		
		
		<p class="excerpt"> This was a strange year for me when it comes to gaming. I was interested in very few of the new games coming out and didn’t necessarily want to spend money on them. The games that I did play, I managed to play because I rented them with Gamefly, but shipping speed put a damper on how quickly I could play them.</p>
