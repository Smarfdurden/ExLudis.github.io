	<p>Marvel Snap is online again in the U.S. after it was banned after its publisher, Nuverse, took it down alongside TikTok on Sunday. Second Dinner, the Marvel Snap developer,  <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691" target="_blank">took to twitter</a> to tell fans that it is actively looking for a new publisher to ensure it doesn’t happen in the future. </p>
	
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MARVEL SNAP is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for MARVEL SNAP.<br><br>We know this probably leaves you with even more questions than…</p>&mdash; Second Dinner (@seconddinner) <a href="https://twitter.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
	<p>This seems like a good idea considering the volatility of their publisher’s relationship with the U.S. at the moment. TikTok, along with Marvel Snap, was taken offline on January 19 over “national security concerns” and was brought back online after around 14 hours. </p>
	
	<p>Marvel Snap seems to have regained its average player base on Steam, but the ban did leave Marvel Snap with mixed recent reviews after it was review bombed after the ban. It’s got to be frustrating to be Second Dinner right now since the U.S. ban had nothing to do with them. </p>

	<p>On Sunday when the ban was implemented, Second Dinner said on X that them being taken down along with TikTok was “a surprise to us and wasn’t planned”. Despite TikTok and Marvel Snap being online currently, it’s still down on both the App Store and Google Play. Second Dinner says they are working on bringing it back to mobile stores.</p>
	
    <p> Marvel Snap is a pretty good card game, and it really is a shame for it to get mixed up in the TikTok fiasco. Hopefully they can find a new publisher soon and never have to worry about how TikTok is going to affect them.</p>

      I write about video games for  consoles and PC. I tend to gravitate to RPG's, looter shooters, hero shooters, and the occasional 4x or card game. I'm a big fan of the Witcher Series (but not the netflix series) and the Destiny franchise, but I play nearly every big release that comes out with indie games sprinkled into the mix.   </p>
