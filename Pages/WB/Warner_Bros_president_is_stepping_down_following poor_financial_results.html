    <h1>Warner Bros. president is stepping down following poor financial results</h1>

	<p>Warner Bros. Interactive <a href=" https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank">announced on Thursday</a>  that David Haddad, the president of its gaming division, is stepping down. The announcement follows the company's latest financial results, which identified the gaming division as "substantially underperforming its potential."</p>

  <blockquote> “David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title,” Warner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming and Games CEO JB Perrette told Variety." <footer>-JB Perrette, WB CEO</footer> </blockquote>
    
	<p>This isn't a surprise to anyone paying attention to the video games put out by the company in the last few years - <a href=" https://gamerant.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-sales-failed/" target="_blank">both Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and <a href=" https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/warner-bros-says-multiversus-is-one-reason-its-games-division-is-substantially-underperforming/" target="_blank">Multiversus massively underperformed.</a></p>

	<p>Some have blamed the poor sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League on the game's genre as a live-service shooter, but I don’t think that’s entirely accurate. Helldivers 2, another live-service shooter, launched shortly after and achieved immense success, selling over a million copies—even without being sold on Xbox. </p>
	
	<p>When it comes to Multiversus, I'm not sure there's much of an appetite for a smash bros. like game with a new IP. Multiversus isn't the only game to release these last few years trying to tap into that genre niche - Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, which released in November 2023, is currently sitting at 13 players according to steam charts, with an all-time peak of 1,578 players.</p>

  <p> I played Multiversus and I enjoyed it a lot for what it was despite not being the biggest fan of fighting games. I really enjoyed some of the IP like Adventure Time, but it wasn't enough for me to stick around. </p>

  <p> I appreciate the effort that went into pulling Multiversus from the store and reworking it, but I think it was pretty clear from its first launch that the interest just wasn't there. </p>

  <p> Warner Bros. hasn't put out all flops, though - Hogwarts Legacy was a massive success, and the company has shared that making a sequel is a priority for the company. </p>

  <p> I hope this change in leadership will lead to better games and less microtransactions - David Haddad greenlit many controversial <a href=" https://kotaku.com/shadow-of-war-is-now-microtransaction-free-1827666902" target="_blank">games such as Shadow of War,</a> which was a single-player game that launched with loot boxes of all things and had to remove them less than a year later due to player backlash and poor sales. </p>
