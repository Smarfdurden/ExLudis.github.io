    <p>Warner Bros. Interactive has been taking heavy losses <a href=" https://smarfdurden.com/Pages/WB/Warner_Bros_president_is_stepping_down_following%20poor_financial_results.html " target="_blank">following their company's latest financial</a> results and the bad news keep coming. Multiversus, the fighting game featuring only WB characters, is being taken offline permanently at the end of season 5 on May 30. That means there's nearly 4 months left to play Multiversus online, at which point you'll have to play in offline with up to 3 friends locally.</p>
	
	  <p>When season 5 drops, they'll be adding two new characters: DC's Aquaman and Looney Tunes' Lola Bunny. It's great that they're adding new characters, but sad that those characters will only be available for three months before being pulled offline. Players will be able to play offline, but you'll need to install the latest version of the game <em>during</em> season 5 because starting May 30, the game will be pulled off of all stores and will no longer be downloadable.  </p>
	
    <blockquote> "This decision was not made lightly. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have put our heart and soul into MultiVersus, creating a unique social and cooperative experience from the ground up that brings together a variety of popular characters and worlds. We are very proud of the game weâ€™ve built and are incredibly thankful for the support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey. Your passion and enthusiasm have been unmatched." <footer>- Multiversus FAQ</footer></blockquote>

	  <p>I'll admit to being disappointed. Multiversus was a solid fighting game and I found a lot of the characters pretty enjoyable to play. When the game was first pulled offline back in 2023, it was clear to me that this game didn't have the audience to keep it afloat. Now after this announcement, I don't see myself downloading the game to play offline because then I'll <em>never</em> be able to uninstall it, at least on console.</p>
	
    <p> Multiversus had a lot of fun ideas. I loved being able to change the animation that plays when you knock someone off the stage, so I could play as Finn or Jake and knock someone off the screen and seeing Marceline gracefully float across the screen, strumming her guitar and singing. Using Finn, you'd collect treasure off of opponents when you hit them that you use to buy power ups from Choose Goose. It added a lot of suspense to matches trying to maintain my collection of coins and waiting for the perfect moment to summon the goose.</p>

    <p>Some characters were really frustrating to fight. The Iron Giant was an absolute menace and could wipe out a whole team by repeatedly using his jump and slam ability, and I have no idea if these issues were ever addressed, but they. </p>

    <p>It really seems like there isn't a company with a roster of characters as popular as Nintendo's - Both Nickelodeon and WB have tried and failed twice to utilize their IP to compete, and both of them fizzled out without much fanfare. </p>

    I write about video games for  consoles and PC. I tend to gravitate to RPG's, looter shooters, hero shooters, and the occasional 4x or card game. I'm a big fan of the Witcher Series (but not the netflix series) and the Destiny franchise, but I play nearly every big release that comes out with indie games sprinkled into the mix. </p>
