    <h1>Nintendo Responds to Leaks: "Not Official"</h1>
  </div>

  <section class="boxed-section">
    
	<p>Yesterday, I wrote an article covering all the Nintendo Switch 2 leaks from CES and online, and now Nintendo has finally released a statement addressing them.</p>
    
	<p>Nintendo responded to the Japanese publication Sankei. “These images and videos are not official,” a representative for Nintendo told Sankei."</p>
    
	<p>It's a funny statement to me because it isn't saying that the leaks are fake, just that they're "not official", which is stating the obvious. One of the leaks was from Genki showing off a replica model of the Switch 2, which would obviously not be official so it's kind of a meaningless statement.</p>
    
	<p>Nintendo went this long without addressing the leaks, so I'm not sure why they didn't just say nothing at all. This statement only serves to make me feel more confident that the leaks are in fact legitimate, but what do I know? I'm not a public relations professional.</p>
    
	<p>I'll keep updating on news about the Nintendo Switch 2, but in case you missed it here's what's been leaked so far:</p>
	
	<p>OnLeaks, in collaboration with 91mobiles, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">shared a 360-degree render of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> telling us the following:</p>
    <p><ul>
	  <li>The new model features an 8.4-inch screen, a considerable upgrade from the original Switch’s 6.2-inch display.</li>
	  
	  <li>The next Switch will retain a 3.5mm headphone jack on top, along with a USB Type-C charging port next to it—a welcome change for anyone like me who found charging the Switch while using it in handheld mode frustrating.</li>
	  
	  <li>The kickstand will feature a ‘U’ shaped kickstand for playing on table-top mode.</li>
	  
	  <h4 style="text-align: left;">Other leaks include:</h4>
	  
	  <li>Yesterday, a user on Reddit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&embed_host_url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-accessories-listed-by-gamestop-reveal-yet-more-details-about-the-unannounced-console/">posted a picture of a new SKU</a> indicating that the Switch 2 will support MicroSD express cards which are faster than the cards currently supported in the original Switch.</li>
	  
	  <li>Last week, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">alleged images of the new Joy-Cons were leaked</a> online showing that the new controllers will have a magnetic connection rather than sliding together on a rail.</li>
	  
	  <li>Digital Foundry did a <a href="DF Direct Weekly #195: Switch 2 Motherboard Leak, HQ GTA6 Trailer, Nintendo Upscaling Patent!">segment on the new Switch 2 motherboard.</a></li>
	  
	  <li>At CES, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-switch-2-replica-is-being-showcased-behind-closed-doors-at-ces/">Genki showed off a replica model of the Switch 2</a> that is said to feature the exact dimensions of the upcoming console.</li>
