	<p>Electronic Arts <a href= "https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" target="_blank">released patch five today.</a> which included a message saying they are moving to "monitoring for game-breaking bugs" and thanks for playing, which I'm taking to mean it's the final patch for the game. </p>

  <blockquote> “Thank you all for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard; we were so happy with the game’s stability at launch and hope you have enjoyed our Quality of Life patches since then. With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!" </blockquote>
    
	<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been out since October and released in pretty good shape. There were very few bugs and it had a complete story on launch. It's also been known for a while Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href= "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank"> wasn't going to get any post-launch DLC</a>, paired with the recent news from <a href= "https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank"> EA's quarterly shareholder meeting</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard performed below their expectations, it makes sense they want to wrap up production on the game. </p>
	
	<blockquote> During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio; however, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations. 
  
  <br>

  This month, our teams delivered a comprehensive gameplay refresh in addition to our annual Team of the Year update in FC 25; positive player feedback and early results are encouraging. We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline. <footer>-Andrew Wilson, CEO of EA</footer></blockquote>

	<p>Electronic Arts has never been shy about ending production on games - Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem are two high-profile examples of them cutting their losses on a project. While Dragon Age: The Veilguard reviewed well, it released to mixed receptions within the community.  There was the usual "This game is too woke" crowd screeching about the non-binary character in the game, but even many of the die-hard dragon age fans were disappointed. It had been 10 years since the last installment in the series, and here's the new game and the story didn’t quite live up to the expectations fans had for the title. </p>

  <p>The patch notes themselves are quite thin as well - There's no real content there, it's all bug fixes with the exception of adding recommended quest levels to quests above the players level.</p>
	
  <p> On a technical level the game is currently in good shape and currently sits at a <a href= "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank">mostly-positive on steam.</a> This is a good time to pull wind-down production on the game, but it still leaves me feeling disappointed since there's a dragon age-sized hole in my heart Dragon Age: The Veilguard just didn't quite fill. </p>
