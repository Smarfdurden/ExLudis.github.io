	<p>Bioware <a href= "https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" target="_blank">released patch five today.</a> which included a message saying they are moving to "monitoring for game-breaking bugs" and thanks for playing, which I'm taking to mean it's the final patch for the game. </p>

  <blockquote> “Thank you all for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard; we were so happy with the game’s stability at launch and hope you have enjoyed our Quality of Life patches since then. With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!" </blockquote>
    
	<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been out since October and released in pretty good shape. There were very few bugs and it had a complete story on launch. It's also been known for a while Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href= "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank"> wasn't going to get any post-launch DLC</a>, paired with the recent news from <a href= "https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank"> EA's quarterly shareholder meeting</a> that Dragon Age: The Veilguard performed below their expectations - it makes sense they want to wrap up production on the game. </p>
	
	<blockquote> "During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio; however, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations." <footer>-Andrew Wilson, CEO of EA</footer></blockquote>

	<p>Electronic Arts has never been shy about ending production on games - Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem are two high-profile examples of them cutting their losses on a project. While Dragon Age: The Veilguard reviewed well, it released to mixed receptions within the community.  There was the usual "This game is too woke" crowd screeching about the non-binary character in the game, but even many of the die-hard dragon age fans were disappointed. It had been 10 years since the last installment in the series, and here's the new game and the story didn’t live up to the expectations many fans had for the title. </p>

  <p> I wrote my <a href= "https://smarfdurden.com/Pages/Reviews/Veilguard.html">own review on the title</a> recently and while I don't regret my time with the game, it also didn't leave a strong impression on me. The dialogue, while not as awful as some fans made it out to be, still didn't click with me. I wanted a more serious story, but the story Dragon Age wanted to tell was campy and light hearted - which is fine if that's what you want, but I've always been more into darker themes in fantasy.</p>

  <p>The patch notes themselves are quite thin as well - There's no real content there. It's all bug fixes with the exception of adding recommended quest levels to quests above the players level.</p>
	
  <p> On a technical level the game is in good shape and currently sits at a <a href= "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank">mostly-positive on steam.</a> This is a good time to wind-down production on the game, but it still leaves me feeling disappointed since there's a Dragon Age-sized hole in my heart Dragon Age: The Veilguard just didn't quite fill.

      I've been obsessed with games most of my life, but only recently started writing my thoughts down. I cover anything that strikes my fancy, which includes both console and PC games. I tend to gravitate to RPG's, looter shooters, hero shooters, and the occasional 4x or card game.
