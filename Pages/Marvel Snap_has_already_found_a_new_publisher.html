	<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner posted a tweet on X (formerly Twitter) that they've secured a new publisher: Skystone Games. As a U.S.-based company, Skystone appears to be a more stable choice given they <a href="https://smarfdurden.com/Pages/snappublisher.html" target="_blank">were recently banned in the U.S.</a> because their publishers currently own TikTok.</p>

	<p>I'm surprised they were able to find a new publisher so soon after the outage, and I'm curious whether or not this change is going to lead to any changes with their monetization model. The game was praised for its restraint with monetization when it released, but overtime, Marvel Snap has become <a href= "https://snap.fan/news/is-marvel-snap-too-aggressive-with-monetization/"target="_blank"> progressively more expensive,</a>  with some players feeling that the game lacks ways for new players to catch up to veterans who have been playing since release. </p>
	
	<p>In their tweet, Second Dinner thanked it's old publisher, Nuverse,  which makes me wonder if Nuverse is stepping back from its gaming ambitions.  It's been <a href= "https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/marvel-snap-shut-down-tiktok-ban-bytedance-1236278280/"target="_blank"> just 11 days </a> since the game was pulled from storefronts. Without insight into the specifics of their publishing contract, it's unclear how much control Second Dinner had over the decision, but Nuverse didn't seem to make much effort to retain Marvel Snap. </p>
	
	<p>I haven't picked up the game in a while but if the new publisher makes positive changes to the monetization model, I'd be willing to come back. I always enjoyed it, but over time was put off by how much it wanted me to spend to keep up. I won't hold my breath as Marvel Snap is still incredibly successful. In October last year, it was announced that <a href= "https://www.pocketgamer.biz/marvel-snap-surpasses-275-million-as-it-celebrates-second-anniversary/"target="_blank"> Marvel Snap's gross lifetime earnings reached $276.5 million.</a>  It's unlikely the new company will see that success and decide that they want <em>less</em> of that. </p>
	
    <p> I would love to hear the discussion on why Nuverse was willing to give up their cash cow, but for now all I can do is speculate.</p>

     I write about video games for  consoles and PC. I tend to gravitate to RPG's, looter shooters, hero shooters, and the occasional 4x or card game. I'm a big fan of the Witcher Series (but not the netflix series) and the Destiny franchise, but I play nearly every big release that comes out with indie games sprinkled into the mix. </p>
